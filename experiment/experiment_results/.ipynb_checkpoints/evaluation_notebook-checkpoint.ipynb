    "The detection rate is used to measure the proportion of objects in the environment detected by the pre-trained model in all experiments. During the detection process, the model may not be able to identify the object according to the image captured by the camera. At this time, in the result published by the detection node, the category is none and the confidence is 0. We regard this result as failed. In a single experiment, if the proportion of failed results reache more than 50%, we determine that the robot cannot detect the object at this position. By analyzing the data, we can get the following table:"

    "When the robot is at the initial position, the direction is 45 degrees offset to the object. \n",
    "The object is not in the capture range of the camera. E.g. In figure 1, we can see there is no object displayed in the GUI. When the control node is launched, during the process of robot rotation, the object enters the range of the camera, as it is shown in figure 2. Thus, between the period that the initial direction and the direction the object can enter into the camera range,  The rotation of the robot starts at the same time as the start of the save node to receive data, so the detection result is invalid from the start time to the time when the object enters the range that the camera can capture. Similarly, in the process of completing the 90-degree rotation, the detection result of the time when the object is about to leave the camera range and the time when the robot completes the 90-degree rotation is also invalid. In the project code, we define that the return value of the detection result of this class is None, and the score is 0. Therefore, we need to remove this part of invalid data. In addition, when detecting some objects, the pre-trained model may not be able to detect the object in the whole process, so all the return values of the detection results are invalid. Therefore, in order not to eliminate the results sent because the model itself did not detect the object , we only filter the detection results with valid data greater than 50% of the total data. Figure 3 shows which part of invalid data we elimited."
